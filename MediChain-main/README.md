## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite 6 | Component-based UI with Concurrent Mode; Vite provides near-instant HMR and automatic code splitting — 10–100x faster than CRA |
| Routing | React Router v7 | Nested routes enable the Layout pattern (shared Navbar/BottomNav); PrivateRoute HOC guards protected pages |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 | Utility-first with built-in dark mode (`class` strategy) and responsive prefixes; zero unused CSS in production |
| Animations | Framer Motion v12 | Declarative spring physics, `AnimatePresence` for exit animations, and `useMotionValue` for 60fps cursor updates without React re-renders |
| Auth | Firebase Authentication | Handles JWT sessions, token refresh, Google OAuth, and email/password — no custom backend needed |
| Database | Cloud Firestore | Real-time `onSnapshot` listeners, cursor-based pagination with `startAfter`, and flexible NoSQL schema |
| State Management | React Context API | Lightweight global state for auth (`AuthContext`) and toasts (`ToastContext`); local state via `useState` + `onSnapshot` |
| Icons | lucide-react + react-icons | lucide-react is individually tree-shaken per icon; only used icons are bundled |
| Date Handling | date-fns v4 | Tree-shakeable imports (~2KB per function vs Moment.js's 67KB full bundle) |
| Calendar | react-calendar | Fully controlled date picker for appointment booking |
| Charts | Pure SVG | Custom `DonutChart` + `BarChart` in SVG — saves ~80KB vs Chart.js or Recharts |
| Deployment | Vercel | Zero-config Vite deployment, global CDN, and automatic CI/CD on every `git push` |
